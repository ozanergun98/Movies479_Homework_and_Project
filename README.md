Id and Guid are taken from Record class for all entities except MovieGenre. CRUD operations can be made for Movies, Directors, and Genres. However, while a movie is added into database, a previously added director can be selected for it but a genre cannot be, though it should be possible. Authentication, Login and Logout are missing (I couldn't find the power in me to code them anymore. (ㅠ﹏ㅠ)).
