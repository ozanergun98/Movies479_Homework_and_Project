Id and Guid are taken from Record class for all entities except MovieGenre. CRUD operations can be made for Movies, Directors, and Genres. However, while a movie is added into database, a previously added director can be selected for it but genre cannot be, though it should be possible. Authentication, Login and Logout are missing (I couldn't find the power to code them anymore. ðŸ¥²).
